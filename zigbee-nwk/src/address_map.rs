//! NWK address map (`nwkAddressMap`, R22 Table 3-60 / §3.6.1.9).
//!
//! The address map caches 64-bit IEEE ↔ 16-bit network address pairs for
//! devices *anywhere* in the network — learned from authenticated
//! `Device_annce` frames and from the source IEEE address carried end to end
//! in relayed NWK headers.
//!
//! It is deliberately separate from the neighbor table (R22 §3.6.1.5), which
//! only ever describes devices this one hears directly. Knowing a device's
//! address pair says nothing about whether it is one hop away; routing on
//! such an entry would unicast straight to a multi-hop device, fail with
//! NO_ACK and tear down the route instead of discovering one.
//!
//! Entries are kept in least-recently-updated order; a full map evicts the
//! oldest pair.
